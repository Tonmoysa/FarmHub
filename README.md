# FarmHub - Farm Management Platform

A simplified farm management platform designed for an agritech company. FarmHub allows registration of farms, onboarding of farmers, enrollment of cows, and tracking of daily operations such as milk production and health-related activities.

## üéØ Project Overview

FarmHub is a farm management platform built with Django backend and FastAPI reporting microservice. The platform demonstrates robust data model design, role-based access control, REST APIs using Django REST Framework (DRF), Django Admin configuration for non-technical users, and a read-only reporting service using FastAPI.

### Key Features
- Multi-role user management (SuperAdmin, Agent, Farmer)
- Farm registration and management
- Farmer onboarding and assignment
- Cow enrollment and tracking
- Daily milk production recording
- Health-related activities tracking
- Real-time reporting and analytics
- RESTful API architecture
